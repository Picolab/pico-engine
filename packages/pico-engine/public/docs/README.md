# pico-engine NEXT

NEXT is a rewrite of pico-engine that introduces major improvements.

* Ruleset versioning and sharing to facilitate decentralized code sharing.
* A more pico-centric architecture that makes pico's easier to transfer between hosts.
* Better channel policies.
* A new UI written in React and only uses pico channels to render.
* Built on top of [pico-framework](https://github.com/Picolab/pico-framework) and [select-when](https://github.com/Picolab/select-when).
